   CHANGED: Recorder will not set RequiresRestart to true when 'overriding' default Unity microphone device string.
   ADDED: Unity Microphone helpers methods to Recorder.
   ADDED: new WebRtcAudioDspEditor warnings if component is disabled or Recorder does not use Microphone type.
   CHANGED: minor, Recorder caching moved to Awake from OnEnable.
   CHANGED: WebRtcAudioDsp now supports inactive AudioListener detection and can switch AudioListener used.
   FIXED: minor, channels number for AudioSpeakerMode.Prologic in WebRtcAudioDsp.
   FIXED: Type Short conversion check delayed in WebRtcAudioDsp.

v2.11 (October 11th, 2019)
   PUN2: v2.15 (11b52d6)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5209
   FIXED: changes made to some voice components were not persisted on scene save due to custom editors.
   FIXED: ConnectAndJoin utility script's custom editor errors by removing leftover serialized property.
   CHANGED: [Better, easier Recorder initialization] Recorder.Init(VoiceClient, object) obsolete replaced with Recorder.Init(VoiceConnection).
   ADDED: [Better, easier Recorder initialization] VoiceConnection.InitRecorder(Recorder) method. 
   CHANGED: [Better, easier Recorder initialization] VoiceConnection.PrimaryRecorder is now automatically (internally/implicitly) initialized.
   CHANGED: Recorder.DebugEchoMode disabled when InterestGroup set to a value != 0.
   CHANGED: Recorder.AutoStart hidden in custom editor when Recorder is already initialized.
   CHANGED: always add PrimaryRecorder in ConnectAndJoin utility script if none found no matter the value of AutoTransmit.

   CHANGED: ConnectAndJoin utility script won't override AppVersion.
   CHANGED: VAD calibration now requires transmission to be enabled to work.
   FIXED: Usage of custom Settings with PUN integration.
   FIXED: MissingReferenceException when trying to destroy a Speaker that's already destroyed.
   ADDED: PhotonVoiceView now has a public Init method that you may call to force setup and initialization in case this did not happen automatically which is unexpected.
   FIXED: PhotonVoiceView setup and Recorder initialization with PUN integration that uses manual prefab instantiation by delaying first Init to Start from OnEnable.
   ADDED: New manual instantiation option in CharacterInstantiation utility script which can be tested in DemoVoicePun-Scene.
   FIXED: minor Android build issues when android:allowBackup and some other attributes or properties are used in the application's AndroidManifest.xml.
   ADDED: Option to dispatch incoming messages, even if Time.timeScale = 0: PhotonVoiceNetwork.MinimalTimeScaleToDispatchInFixedUpdate. It defaults to not being used. This idea is borrowed from PUN.
